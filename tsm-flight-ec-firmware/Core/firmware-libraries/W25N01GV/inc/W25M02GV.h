 * Header file for communicating with W25M02GV Flash Memory
 * Datasheet: https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25m02gv%20revf%20050918%20unsecured.pdf
 *
 * NOTE: The W25M02GV is 2 W25N01GV's in a trenchcoat, so this "library"
 * is just a wrapper around the W25N01GV functions.
 *
 * The references to "fc_flash" in this library are because this particular chip
 * is used on the TSM flight computer, as opposed to regular "flash" being
 * used on other TSM/MASA boards.
